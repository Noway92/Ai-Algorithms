This repository contains four projects I developed during my 4th year at ESILV, as part of my specialization in Data and Artificial Intelligence.
The repository includes four Jupyter notebooks:

Search Algorithms: Implementation of informed and uninformed search strategies (Uniform Cost Search, A* Algorithm, and Breadth-First Search) to find the shortest solution path for the 8-Puzzle Problem.

Genetic Algorithm: Optimization of a Neural Network using evolutionary techniques.

Reinforcement Learning: Training an agent to complete the FrozenLake-v1 environment using reinforcement learning methods.

Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP): Solving the Battleship Solitaire Puzzle with constraint programming techniques.
